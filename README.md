# Getting Started

## Scaffolding a New React SPA

Scaffolds a new React SPA with 'project name' being the name of the folder to create.

Gemino will create a simple application that inherits from the SPA template with a simple component and test.

```
gemino new project-name
```

Jest and Babel will inherit from the global Jest and Babel configuration but you can override or add any configuration you need for your application by simpling overriding a key (or modifying the key in place).
